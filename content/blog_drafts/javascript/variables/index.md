Variable holds a value. Following are some of the examples of variables.

```javascript
var name = "Krishna"
var id = 123
```

Above statements define two variables `name`, `id`.

The `var` keyword is used to define variables.

#### Naming constraints

1. Variable name must begin with any alphabet, _ (or) $.
2. Variable name can contain any character.
3. Spaces are not allowed in between variable names.
4. Donâ€™t use Javascript keywords as variable names.
5. Variable names are case sensitive. Name, NAme, name are 3 different variables.

#### Example of variables in JavaScript

Copy and paste de following code in your web browser console:

```javascript
var name = "Krishna";
var id = 123;

console.log("The name is " + name);
console.log("The ID is " + id);
```

Output:

```
The name is Krishna
The ID is 123
```

**Note**: JavaScript is case sensitive, so the names banana, Banana, BaNaNa are three different variables.
