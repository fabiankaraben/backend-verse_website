What is backend?

Well first let's talk about what is not backend, that is, let's talk about what is frontend ?.

Frontend is a layer in software development, the layer of the graphical interface, that is, what the user sees, it can be a mobile app, a web page, to give some examples. On the other hand, backend is the service that runs on a server, what we normally call "the cloud".

The frontend makes requests to the backend. The backend receives a request, performs the necessary validations and processing, and returns a response to the frontend.

Many times the backend work includes queries to a database.

Backend development must be able to respond quickly to thousands or millions of frontend instances, so optimizing algorithms is very important.
