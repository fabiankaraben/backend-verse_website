Go supports concurrent execution of tasks. It means Go can execute multiple tasks simultaneously. 

It is different from the concept of parallelism. 

In parallelism, a task is split into small subtasks and are executed in parallel. 

But in concurrency, multiple tasks are being executed simultaneously.

Concurrency is achieved in Go using Goroutines and Channels.
