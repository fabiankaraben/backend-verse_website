Channels are a way for functions to communicate with each other.

It can be thought as a medium to where one routine places data and is accessed by another routine.

A channel can be declared with the syntax

```go
channel_variable := make(chan datatype)
```

Example:

```go
ch := make(chan int)
```

You can send data to a channel using the syntax

```go
channel_variable <- variable_name
```

Example

```go
ch <- x
```

You can receive data from a channel using the syntax

```go
variable_name := <- channel_variable
```

Example

```
y := <- ch
```

In the above examples of goroutine, you have seen the main program doesn't wait for the goroutine. But that is not the case when channels are involved.

Suppose if a goroutine pushes data to channel, the main() will wait on the statement receiving channel data until it gets the data.

You will see this in below example. First, write a normal goroutine and see the behaviour. Then modify the program to use channels and see the behaviour.

Execute the below program

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func display() {
	time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
	fmt.Println("Inside display()")
}
func main() {
	go display()
	fmt.Println("Inside main()")
}
```

The output will be

```
Inside main()
```

The main() finished the execution and did exit before the goroutine executes. So the print inside the display() didn't get executed.

Now modify the above program to use channels and see the behaviour.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func display(ch chan int) {
	time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
	fmt.Println("Inside display()")
	ch <- 1234
}
func main() {
	ch := make(chan int)
	go display(ch)
	x := <- ch
	fmt.Println("Inside main()")
	fmt.Println("Printing x in main() after taking from channel:", x)
}
```

The output will be

```
Inside display()
Inside main()
Printing x in main() after taking from channel: 1234
```

Here what happens is the `main()` on reaching `x := <-ch` will wait for data on channel ch. The `display()` has a wait of 5 seconds and then push data to the channel `ch`. The `main()v on receiving the data from the channel gets unblocked and continues its execution.

The sender who pushes data to channel can inform the receivers that no more data will be added to the channel by closing the channel. This is mainly used when you use a loop to push data to a channel. 

A channel can be closed using

```go
close(channel_name)
```

And at the receiver end, it is possible to check whether the channel is closed using an additional variable while fetching data from channel using

```go
variable_name, status := <- channel_variable
```

If the status is True it means you received data from the channel. If false, it means you are trying to read from a closed channel.

You can also use channels for communication between goroutines. Need to use 2 goroutines â€“ one pushes data to the channel and other receives the
data from the channel. 

See the below program:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// This subroutine pushes numbers 0 to 9 to the channel and closes the channel
func add_to_channel(ch chan int) {
	fmt.Println("Send data")
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		ch <- i // Pushing data to channel
	}
	close(ch) // Closing the channel
}

// This subroutine fetches data from the channel and prints it.
func fetch_from_channel(ch chan int) {
	fmt.Println("Read data")
	for {
		// Fetch data from channel
		x, flag := <-ch
		// flag is true if data is received from the channel
		// flag is false when the channel is closed
		if flag == true {
			fmt.Println(x)
		} else {
			fmt.Println("Empty channel")
			break
		}
	}
}
func main() {
	// Creating a channel variable to transport integer values
	ch := make(chan int)
	// Invoking the subroutines to add and fetch from the channel
	// These routines execute simultaneously
	go add_to_channel(ch)
	go fetch_from_channel(ch)
	// Delay is to prevent the exiting of main() before goroutines finish
	time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
	fmt.Println("Inside main()")
}
```

Here there are 2 subroutines one pushes data to the channel and other prints data to the channel. The function `add_to_channel` adds the numbers from 0to 9 and closes the channel. 

Simultaneously the function `fetch_from_channel` waits at `x, flag := <-ch` and once the data become available, it prints the data. It exits once the flag is false which means the channel is closed.

The wait in the `main()` is given to prevent the exiting of main() until the goroutines finish the execution.

Execute the code and see the output as

```
Read data
Send data
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
Empty channel
Inside main()
```
