Types(data types) represent the type of the value stored in a variable, type of the value a function returns, etc.

There are three basic types in Go.

## Numeric types

Represent numeric values which includes integer, floating point, and complex values. Various numeric types are:

- `int8` - 8 bit signed integers.
- `int16` - 16 bit signed integers.
- `int32` - 32 bit signed integers.
- `int64` - 64 bit signed integers.
- `uint8` - 8 bit unsigned integers.
- `uint16` - 16 bit unsigned integers.
- `uint32` - 32 bit unsigned integers.
- `uint64` - 64 bit unsigned integers.
- `float32` - 32 bit floating point numbers.
- `float64` - 64 bit floating point numbers.
- `complex64` â€“ has float32 real and imaginary parts.
- `complex128` - has float32 real and imaginary parts.

## String types

Represents a sequence of bytes (characters).

You can do various operations on strings like string concatenation, extracting substring, etc

## Boolean types

Represents 2 values, either `true` or `false`.
